Once upon a time there was a boy named Data. Throughout his life, he was always trying to understand what his purpose was. What values do I have? What impact can I make on this world? Where does Data come from? See any similarities between you and Data? These questions were always in his mind and fortunately, through sheer luck, Data finally came across a solution and went through a great transformation.

It all started as Data was walking down the rows when he came across a weird, yet interesting, pipe. On one end was a pipe with an entrance and at the other end an exit. The pipe was also labeled with five distinct letters: “O.S.E.M.N.”. Curious as he was, Data decided to enter the pipeline. Long story short… in came data and out came insight.

The Data Science Pipeline
=========================

Data soon realized: You’re awesome. I’m awesome. Data Science is OSEMN. Se, let's disect what happened in this OSEMN pipe.

-   **O:** Obtaining our data
-   **S:** Scrubbing / Cleaning our data
-   **E:** Exploring / Visualizing our data will allow us to find patterns and trends
-   **M:** Modeling our data will give us our predictive power as a wizard
-   **N:** Interpreting our data

**O:** Obtaining our data
-------------------------

First things first. Without data, no science.

You cannot do anything as a data scientist without even having any data. As a rule of thumb, there are some things you must take into consideration when obtaining your data. You must identify all of your available datasets (which can be from the internet or external/internal databases). You must extract the data into a usable format (.csv, json, xml, etc..)
